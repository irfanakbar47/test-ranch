          <ol className="space-y-4 pl-4">
            <li><span className="font-bold">6.1</span>&nbsp;Initiate a Claim through the Registration App. The Registration App must have been on the Eligible Device you registered at the time of damage. The Registration App will be used to verify your registration and device information.</li>

Your device must have the Product installed/applied and in place when the device is sent for inspection. Upon approval, you will be referred to an approved service center or in most cases a repair center of your choice. You are responsible for the cost of repair at the time of repair, however&nbsp;<span className="font-bold">upon completion of the repair you must provide the repair receipt.</span>&nbsp;The repair receipt must show the following:</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">7.1</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">Repairs by a Third Party.</span>&nbsp;If <span className="font-bold">prior to an approved claim</span> you obtain a repair of your Eligible Device from your wireless carrier (i.e., Verizon), Apple, Samsung, Motorola, Google, or any other retailer, then the Limited Guarantee is no longer available to you, and OtterBox is not responsible for reimbursement or payment of any fees or deductibles associated with said repair. The Program is only available to the specific Eligible Device that you registered duringthe Registration Process. By submitting a Claim under the Program, you are representing and warranting to OtterBox that the OtterBox Product was used in accordance with its applicable Instructions. Violation of the foregoing (for example, submitting a Claim when you have modified the OtterBox Product, improperly used the OtterBox Product or used the OtterBox Product outside the specified limits) may constitute fraud, and, in addition to voiding your right to participate in the Program, may subject you to legal action from OtterBox.</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">7.2</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">Program Modifications.</span>&nbsp;OtterBox reserves the right to modify the processes, procedures, parameters, or other terms of theProgram, or terminate the Program entirely, at any time, without prior notice to you. If OtterBox terminates the Program, it may provide you with a one-time Settlement as determined by OtterBox in its sole discretion. The current status of the Program and applicable terms are available on the Registration App.</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">7.3</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS.</span>&nbsp;TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OTTERBOX SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, QUIET ENJOYMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY MAY LAST, SO SUCH LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF APPLICABLE LAW SPECIFIES A MINIMUM GUARANTEE PERIOD, THEN THE GUARANTEE PERIOD FOR PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO SUCH APPLICABLE LAW SHALL BE CONFORMED WITH TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD SO REQUIRED. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVEOTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">7.4</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</span>&nbsp;IN NO EVENT, UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY, WILL OTTERBOX, ITS SERVICE CENTER, DISTRIBUTORS,OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF ANY SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERALDAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF OTTERBOX AND ANY OF ITS SERVICE CENTER, DISTRIBUTORS AND/OR SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM. SOME STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">7.5</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">ARBITRATION.</span>&nbsp;Read The Following Arbitration Provision Carefully. It Limits Certain Rights You May Have, Including Your Right To Obtain Relief or Damages Through Court Action. By registering under the Program for the Program Limited Guarantee, you specifically agree to this arbitration provision. To begin arbitration, either you or OtterBox must make a written demand to the other party for arbitration for the applicable claim <span className="font-bold">(&quot;Arbitration Claim&quot;)</span>. The Arbitration will take place before a single arbitrator. It will be administered in keeping with the Expedited Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules <span className="font-bold">(&quot;Rules&quot;)</span> of the American Arbitration Association <span className="font-bold">(&quot;AAA&quot;)</span> in effect when the Arbitration Claim is filed. You may get a copy of these AAA’s Rules by visiting <Link href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline text-green-primary1 hover:text-green-300">http://www.adr.org</Link>. The filing fees to begin and carry out arbitration will be shared equally between you and OtterBox. This does not prohibit the arbitrator from giving the winning party their fees and expenses of the arbitration. Unless you and OtterBox agree, the arbitration will take place in the county and state where you live. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., will govern and not any state law on arbitration. YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT this arbitration provision means that you give up your right to go to court on any claim covered by this provision. You also agree that any arbitration proceeding will only consider your Arbitration Claim. Claims by, or on behalf of, other individuals will not be arbitrated in any proceeding that is considering your Arbitration Claim. THE DEGREE TO WHICH ARBITRATION CAN BE USED AS A DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS FOR CONSUMER CLAIMS VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE, SO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, DEPENDING ON YOUR STATE OF RESIDENCE. In the event this arbitration provision is not approved by the appropriate state regulatory agency, and/or is stricken, severed, or otherwise deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, you and OtterBox specifically agree to waive and forever give up theright to a trial by jury. Instead, in the event any litigation arises between you and OtterBox, any such lawsuit will be tried before a judge, and a jury will not be impaneled or struck.</li>
