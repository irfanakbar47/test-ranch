            What&#39;s Covered: Subject to all terms, conditions, exclusions, and limitations set forth herein, for a period of one (1) year beginning on the date of purchase of the SIMPLE Product, if your Eligible Device suffers a cracked screen while the SIMPLE Product is properly affixed to the Eligible Device and the cracked screen causes your Eligible Device to not operate as intended, the SIMPLE Limited Guarantee covers reimbursement towards the actual cost to repair a cracked screen on your Eligible Device and is limited to a maximum benefit amount that is determined by the SIMPLE Product purchased, ranging between USD $100.00 and USD $250.00. The maximum benefit amount specified on the SIMPLE Product packaging is a material term of this Limited Guarantee and is incorporated herein by reference. This amount will be applied towards the repair or replacement of your Eligible Device&#39;s&nbsp;<span className="font-bold">screen only</span>&nbsp;at approved repair facilities specified by the Service Center at the time a Claim is initiated through the Service Center.

          <p>
            What&#39;s Excluded: This Limited Guarantee expressly excludes all Physical Damage to the Eligible Device other than screen breakage.&nbsp;<span className="font-bold">&quot;Physical Damage&quot;</span>&nbsp;is defined as damage to the internal or external components of the Eligible Device (including processors, circuit boards, control buttons, cameras, back glass/encasements).

              <p>
                You will be reimbursed based on the amount of repair minus any amount covered by your warranty/insurance carrier and minus any applicable processing fee. You may elect to be reimbursed electronically using PayPal, or via electronic funds transfer (EFT) via Automated Clearing House (ACH). While SIMPLE does not charge any processing fees for these electronic reimbursement options, third party service providers (e.g., PayPal) may assess their own processing fees to receive funds through their platforms. Alternatively, you may elect to be reimbursed by check. If you elect to receive your reimbursement payment (<span className="font-bold">&quot;Settlement&quot;</span>) via check, a USD $12.99 processing fee will be deducted from the Settlement payment, which will be sent to the address on file, payable to the name of the person registered. If your Claim has been denied, a reason for denial (such as, for example, incomplete information, mismatched information, incorrect Product application, etc.) will be provided.

            <li><span className="font-bold">6.1</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">Repairs by a Third Party.</span>&nbsp;If&nbsp;<span className="font-bold">prior to an approved Claim</span>&nbsp;you obtain a repair of your Eligible Device from any third party, including but not limited to your wireless carrier (e.g., Verizon), Apple, Samsung, Motorola, Google, or any other retailer, then the Limited Guarantee is no longer available to you, and SIMPLE is not responsible for reimbursement or payment of any fees or deductibles associated with said repair. The Program is only available to the specific Eligible Device that you registered during the Registration Process. By submitting a Claim under the Program, you are representing and warranting to SIMPLE that the SIMPLE Product was used in accordance with its applicable Instructions. Violation of the foregoing (for example, submitting a Claim when you have modified the SIMPLE Product, improperly used the SIMPLE Product or used the SIMPLE Product outside the specified limits) may constitute fraud, and, in addition to voiding your right to participate in the Program, may subject you to legal action from SIMPLE.</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">6.2</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">Program Modifications.</span>&nbsp;SIMPLE reserves the right to modify the processes, procedures, parameters, or other terms of the Program, or terminate the Program entirely, at any time, without prior notice to you. If SIMPLE terminates the Program, it may provide you with a one-time Settlement as determined by SIMPLE in its sole discretion. The current status of the Program and applicable terms are available on the instaProtek App.</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">6.3</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS.</span>&nbsp;TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SIMPLE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, QUIET ENJOYMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY MAY LAST, SO SUCH LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF APPLICABLE LAW SPECIFIES A MINIMUM GUARANTEE PERIOD, THEN THE GUARANTEE PERIOD FOR PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO SUCH APPLICABLE LAW SHALL BE CONFORMED WITH TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD SO REQUIRED. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">6.4</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</span>&nbsp;IN NO EVENT, UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY, WILL SIMPLE, ITS SERVICE CENTER, DISTRIBUTORS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF ANY SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF SIMPLE AND ANY OF ITS SERVICE CENTER, DISTRIBUTORS AND/OR SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM. SOME STATES AND/OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">6.5</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">ARBITRATION.</span>&nbsp;Read the following arbitration provision carefully. It limits certain rights you may have, including your right to obtain relief or damages through court action. By registering under the Program for the Program Limited Guarantee, you specifically agree to this arbitration provision. To begin arbitration, either you or SIMPLE must make a written demand to the other party for arbitration for the applicable claim (<span className="font-bold">&quot;Arbitration Claim&quot;</span>). The arbitration will take place before a single arbitrator. It will be administered in keeping with the Expedited Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules (&quot;Rules&quot;) of the American Arbitration Association (<span className="font-bold">&quot;AAA&quot;</span>) in effect when the arbitration Claim is filed. You may get a copy of these AAA&#39;s Rules by visiting&nbsp;<Link href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline text-green-primary1 hover:text-green-3000">http://www.adr.org</Link>.&nbsp;The filing fees to begin and carry out arbitration will be shared equally between you and SIMPLE. This does not prohibit the arbitrator from giving the winning party their fees and expenses of the arbitration. Unless you and SIMPLE agree, the arbitration will take place in the county and state where you live. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., will govern and not any state law on arbitration. YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT this arbitration provision means that you give up your right to go to court on any claim covered by this provision. You also agree that any arbitration proceeding will only consider your Arbitration Claim. Claims by, or on behalf of, other individuals will not be arbitrated in any proceeding that is considering your arbitration Claim. THE DEGREE TO WHICH ARBITRATION CAN BE USED AS A DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS FOR CONSUMER CLAIMS VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE, SO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, DEPENDING ON YOUR STATE OF RESIDENCE. In the event this arbitration provision is not approved by the appropriate state regulatory agency, and/or is stricken, severed, or otherwise deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, you and SIMPLE specifically agree to waive and forever give up the right to a trial by jury. Instead, in the event any litigation arises between you and SIMPLE, any such lawsuit will be tried before a judge, and a jury will not be impaneled or struck.</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">6.6</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">Savings Clause.</span>&nbsp;All parts of this Limited Guarantee shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law or unless prohibited by applicable law. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that SIMPLE cannot enforce a part of this Limited Guarantee as written, that part shall be deemed replaced with similar terms to the extend enforceable under the applicable law (or where the court will not amend this Limited Guarantee, such part will be severed), but the remainder of this Limited Guarantee shall not be altered.</li>

            <li><span className="font-bold">6.7</span>&nbsp;<span className="underline">Repairs.</span>&nbsp;SIMPLE does not warranty, is not responsible for and shall not be liable for repairs performed on your Eligible Device. Some repairs may void the manufacturer&#39;s warranty on your Eligible Device. Unless a mandatory provision of applicable law provides otherwise, repairs performed in satisfaction of this Limited Guarantee may utilize new or refurbished parts.</li>
